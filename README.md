Overview
This project aims to predict hotel reservation cancellations using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical reservation data to forecast cancellations and assist hotels in optimizing their booking strategies. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project Description
The project focuses on predicting the likelihood of hotel reservation cancellations based on historical booking data. By employing various machine learning models, the project aims to identify patterns and factors contributing to cancellations. This can help hotels minimize revenue loss and improve booking management.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes information about hotel reservations, such as:

Reservation_ID: Unique identifier for each reservation
Booking_Date: Date when the reservation was made
Checkin_Date: Date of check-in
Checkout_Date: Date of check-out
Hotel_Type: Type of hotel (e.g., city hotel, resort)
Number_of_Nights: Number of nights booked
Number_of_Guests: Number of guests
Reservation_Status: Status of the reservation (e.g., confirmed, canceled)
Lead_Time: Number of days between booking and check-in
Room_Type: Type of room reserved

Results
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Implemented and trained various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Insights: Provided actionable insights to reduce cancellation rates and optimize booking strategies.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code)
